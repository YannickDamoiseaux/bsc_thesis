### Bachelor thesis, Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, Maastricht University

## Running the code
___
The code can be run using the Main class in src.main.java. If you want to run a different solver or use a different 
graph, you can modify line 15 in the Main class with your preferred solver and or graph. A lot of graphs are available in 
the resources folder. If you want to use your own graphs, simply add them to the resources folder.
